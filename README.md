### `Look`

In this project, to build this Medik site I'm using `react js` , `material UI`, `react Bootstrap`, `node`, `mongoDB`, `express`. At Medik, Users get a good experience to `explore` our niche product and `purchase` it. Our `Payment` method system will be available soon. Users can see their own Order's list at the `Myorder` section, also can give `review` with rating. At Admin dashboard, admin can `Add product`, `Manage All Order`, `Manage All Product`, `Make Admin`. About us and Contact section described Medik facilities and keep the user in touch with us.
